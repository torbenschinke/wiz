Preface
-------
The idea of a robust, simple and scalable storage format superseeding the 
lowest denomiator filesystems, fascinated me already 15 years ago, 
however I never had the opportunity to actually start implementing such a project. 
When the time came, I started to design a paper based specification in 2015 which 
performs well for deduplicating large files, nested directory trees and 
continues snapshots. To solve the typical problems of a 'multi file based 
document format' at work, I created a proprietary java based implementation 
from it, called wiz - which is just the opposite of a git, similarities are 
purely coincidental. For the original intention, it worked pretty well. 
But as requirements changed, the performance for a lot of additional use 
cases was disappointing. The main performance issues are caused by both, 
inherent format decisions and the necessity of a complex virtual machine. 
In practice, the latter caused also penalties on the probably most successful 
mobile platform of our time. To solve all of these issues I started to design 
an entirely new specification which addresses all of the new additional 
scenarios (and even more). Hereafter this new specification is actually 
'wiz version 3' or simply 'wiz'. Therefore the proprietary existing wiz 
implementation is called 'legacy wiz' and is not only implemented in a 
different language but also does a lot of things differently to improve 
performance, storage usage, reliability and system complexity. 
Today, the market for closed source commercial software libraries is nearly 
dead and gaining money or finding acceptance is not easy. 
Usually large companies dominate the market with a lot (but definity not all) 
high quality products.



Format specification
--------------------
Wiz is both, an implementation and a specification.
In this chapter only the specification matters and is described 
in a way that it can be implemented in any language and ecosystem.

Everything in the world of wiz is represented by a node, which always
starts with a byte identifier. Besides that, there are no other common
properties among node types. 

Some nodes support compression for their payload, but it is not a generic
feature. In contrast to that, encryption is a property of the pageing infrastructure
itself. I believe that providing unencrypted insight into meta information
is already an absolute security flaw. Examples for this are stacked filesystems
like EncFs or eCryptfs, which provides plain information about the folder structure,
amount of files and the file sizes. Keeping facts about nodes unencrypted and just
encrypt payload would be the same kind of security flaw.

Pointers to nodes have a variadic size from 2 bytes upto 20 bytes, which boils
down to a theoretical 128 bit addressing, in which the first 10 bytes refer to
the id of a virtual device (vdev) and the last 10 bytes to a physical offset. 
The additonal two bytes are caused by the overhead of the varint LEB128 encoding. 
The vdev is usually a simple file in your host's filesystem. 
Using this technique, the pointer adapts itself to 
different use cases, like many small vdevs or
a single large file. The usage of a varint favors storage costs over
performance. Addressing millions of nodes, especially in independent vdev sets
- I think of an online mirror storage - would waste a lot of space. In this
scenario, one could argue that the performance penalties are also on 
the client side and will not stress the server at all. There are also
use cases in which a high fragmentation is caused. In such scenarios
it is cheaper to resolve physical addresses over another indirection. For this
there are a number of reserved 'vdev' ids.

All texts should be encoded in UTF-8, however there is no simple answer for filepaths.
When taking a look at Git and how it handles filenames, it works perfectly on
Linux filesystems, which just treat a filename as a byte sequence but fails
miserably when mixing platforms like MacOS and Windows. Some users expect an
UTF-8 normalization and others excoriate that. So we also keep that decision to
a preprocess. Moreover, instead of following the errornous c approach of zero 
termination, we also use a varint as a length encoding, which has the same
overhead for most expected strings (up to 127 byte, runes may vary). We define
a text payload always as UTF-8 (a varint prefixed array of uint8) and undefined
text payload as a varint prefixed array of uint8.

TIP: Nodes need not to be aligned to physical sectors, but if you do so, one can expect 
better performance and recoverability but you will sacrifice space efficiency. 
Consider a 4k sector alignment for todays devices.

In general, byte order is the common network order - big endian. Most elements
are already invariant to endianess, like varint or arrays. There is no expectation
that a specialization to the host endianess will actually result in any performance
gain, for an implementation of this specification.


In the following, offsets are always defined in hexadecimal values prefixed by
0x. Fixed array values are also declared using hex values, but with 0x omitted.

|==============================================

As you can see from the example encoding table <<a:table-leb128,table>> one can expect that most 'ndptr' values
will be in the size of 1 for the 'vdev' and 4-6 for the offset, so expect an average 
size of 5-7 byte per pointer. So in contrast to a naive encoding of a full 128bit 
pointer we only need 30% to 43% of the space which is even less than for an
uncompressed 64bit pointer. 

TIP: You can also use virtual addresses when using the reserved 'vdev' id.
This makes things like defragmentation and sector relocation a lot easier but
introduces a significant overhead.

WBO specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'wiz binary object' serialization format is specified by the following 
BNF like declaration. It is somewhat comparable to the BSON format
(see <<bson>>) but uses the packed
varint format from above to improve space efficency. Due to the copy-on-write
approach, we do not plan to update a distinct data field within a written structure.
BSON cannot guarantee that either when increasing the length of a string.

|==============================================

Record format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As already pointed out, the actual format is represented as nodes. However also
nodes are organized within a higher level structure, named 'record'. Records
are used to introduce other properties which should be common to all nodes,
like generic checksums, extra redundancy, encryption or message authentication. 
The first node, the 'magic node', contains all relevant parameters for the
record configuration, including the first node itself. The type of a record
is always the same for the entire 'vdev-set', and therefore needs not any
overhead, like headers or size attributes. Currently only records of a fixed
size of 4096 byte are allowed. This size is used primarily to match today's
physical storage devices which works with 4k sectors. Also a lot of legacy
filesystems are driven with 4k sectors, so this looks like a good fit.
Actually there seems to be no real reason to limit the record size, so
it is a runtime configuration and this specification may be extended in
the near future. The primary goal of a record is to verify that the contained
data has not been tampered, either by a machine failure like random bitrots
or due to a real attacker. Remember that protecting against attackers is only possible 
by using a 'hmac' or similar authentication techniques. An implementation has
to verify the record before evaluating the contained nodes. An implementation
should provide recovery methods based on records by at least ignoring the defunct one and 
continue reading the next record. Due to the fixed
record size but with different overhead, the actual payload size is different from
type to type. The common property is that each record starts with a node and contains
at least a valid one. However it is expected to put as many nodes into a record as
possible to improve space efficiency. The minimal file size of a valid 'vdev' depends
on the record size and is at least one record.

Magic node
~~~~~~~~~~
Marks a container and must be always the first node of a file and should not 
occur once again. If it does (e.g. for recovery purposes), it is not allowed 
to be contradictory. Wiz containers can simply be identified using the magic 
bytes '[00 03 77 69 7a 63]'.

[width="100%", cols="3,^3,^3,^3,^3,10", options="header"]

| 0x01 |4 |uint32 | version | 0x03 | this is the third version of the wiz format
| 0x05 |4 |[]uint8 | magic | [77 69 7a 63] | the magic header value 'wizc' for the container 
| 0x06 |1 |uint8 | encryption type | * | the kind of encryption algorithm for the pages
| 0x07 |* |utf8 | sub magic | * | the user defined sub magic header value as varuint prefixed UTF-8
| #5    |16 |UUID | wiz file set identifier |* | the UUID of this wiz storage. Any vdev id and therefore ndptr is only valid within the same set of wiz files sharing the same UUID.
| #6 | 1-10| varuint| vdev id | * | The unique vdev id of this wiz file within the file set. Should start with 0.
|==============================================


The 'version' indicates which nodes and how they are defined. 
A node format may be changed in future revisions but should be 
extended in a backwards compatible manner. If such a thing is not 
possible (e.g. also by adding new kinds) the number increases. Because
the format depends on the node kind (and therefore the sizes to parse)
an outdated reader can actually only use it's recovery options to continue
reading.


_Some notes to the version flag: Actually this is the third generation of the 
wiz format. The first only existed on paper, the second was implemented largely 
based on the paper based specification but is proprietary. So this is the first 
which is now open source. It is not only implemented in a different language but 
also does a lot of things differently to improve performance, storage usage, 
reliability and system complexity._

One of the basic ideas of wiz is to replace custom 'on disk formats' with
something better. Today, probably the most widespreaded format is the zip file
format from pkware. Amongst others, it is used by the entire Microsoft Office
suite for their '*x files'. To easily identify such subformats, the wiz header
defines an UTF-8 subformat specifier. In the following table one can see 
a list of known sub format identifiers. If you create your own identifier,
use your reversed company or product internet domain, e.g. 'com.mycompany.myproduct'
to minimize collisions. You may also invent your own file extension, but as a rule 
of thumb, you should never rely on it and check the magic node instead.

The encryption formats are defined as follows:

See the encryption chapter for the detailed specification of each encryption mode.

A wiz storage may consist of multiple files or devices, which have each their own
magic node but a unique vdev id. Any 'ndptr' contains also that id, so referred nodes
can be spreaded across vdevs. Use cases for this may be to improve performance, 
to create append-only / WORM (write once read many) storages or simply to attach
additional storage volumes. 
To detect which vdevs belong to the same vdev set, a unique UUID is assigned to 
each set. You should not rely on a file name to identify a set, if the user
has access to the files. 

TIP: Choose wisely your trade-of when considering (large) file
sets, especially when dealing with end users. A common expectation is
that an application stores a document always in a single file.

It is a hard descision where to write and update the 'super node'. Depending
on the use case it is either unrealistic (linear growing amount of vdevs) or 
even impossible (WORM) to update existing vdevs, hence there is no definitive rule
here. 

TIP: Each application has to define where to write or update 
the 'super node'.

In order to alleviate the situation, there are some well defined use cases.
If a type matches your use case, apply one of the following rules.

Type 1
^^^^^^
For single file formats (ever a single vdev) always update the ringbuffer. 

Type 2
^^^^^^
A performance optimized stripe vdev set (like RAID 0) only updates
the ring buffer in the vdev with the lowest number (typical 16). Stripe sets
are wobbly anyway. So actually 'Type 1' is only a special case of a stripe set
with a single vdev.

Type 3
^^^^^^
For redundant vdevs (like mirrors / RAID 1 / RAID 5) always update the ringbuffer
in every vdev.

Type 4
^^^^^^
For WORM / append-only formats only write a new super node to the added vdev
and never change an already written file.




Configuration node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The wiz repository (as defined by the file) may include different properties. 
These properties are important to open the repository properly, e.g. picking 
the correct hash algorithm. The hash algorithm has a fixed length, but not a fixed
algorithm. However the algorithm configured is valid for the entire vdev set
and must not change between vdevs. It will be used for all hashed data structures.
The configuration also may contain persistent optional settings for tweaking, 
which are represented in the wbo. This node directly follows the magic node.

.on-disk format of the configuration node
[width="100%", cols="3,^3,^3,^3,^3,10", options="header"]

| Offset| Size | Type | Name | Value | Description

| 0x01 |1 |uint8 | hash algorithm | * | the hash algorithm to use, which must always be 256 bits / 32 byte in length
| 0x02 |1 - 10|varuint| reserved |*| the reserved space for the wbo object. 
| 0x01 |*|wbo| configuration|*|key value properties in <<a:wbo-spec,wbo>> format
|==============================================

By default, the reserved space for the 'wbo' should be the difference between the
actual size of the magic node and the first physical sector at offset 0x1000.
However, a writer may decide to ignore that and not to provide any reserved space
or even provide more sectors.

TIP: A configuration node should provide some space to allow changes to the 
'wbo', so that permanent changes are possible without rewriting the entire file.

In general, the configuration node is not intended to be modified on a regular basis,
and therefore there is no infrastructure to provide any resilence here. The settings
here are intended to be written either at creation time or for recovering or debugging
purposes.

|0x01|SHA-512/256

|==============================================

Super node
~~~~~~~~~~
The super node is a ring buffer having a variable amount of <<a:transaction-node,transaction entries>> 
which are written in a round-robin manner. The minimum valid capacity is 1 and the maximum
amount if 255. The larger the ring buffer, the more possiblities to recover older states
are available. Consider e.g. a capacity of 128 for single file formats, but 1
when appending only new immutable vdevs. Otherwise provide at least the space for 2 nodes.
The transaction node with the highest transaction
id and a valid checksum is the transaction node to use. If something went wrong,
older transactions may be used for recovery, but the usefulness depends on the kind
of damage. Usually one would expect that if the transaction is written to the
ring buffer and the underlying file system crashes, it hopefully will loose the
data in the same order (the transaction node is always the last thing written), 
however there is no guarantee on that. Also fsync cannot protect us from that, 
because it is broken on many filesystems, even by design (see also <<btrfs-fsync>>).
Today, I don't know how to solve that properly. 

TIP: To get the best resilence, you should never overwrite any data and instead create a new vdev
for every transaction and fsync the file contents and the directory in the right
order.

The super node must be the third node after the 'configuration node' and should be 
located at file offset 0x1000. But remember, that depending on the reserved space of
the wbo in the configuration node, there is no guarantee for that.

TIP: The super node is rewritten for each transaction and has a high write 
amplification. It should always match the physical addressing of the file system
or the raw device to optimize performance.

[[a:transaction-node]]
Transaction node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The transaction node is the entry point which defines an applied transaction
and all references to nodes which describe the valid state of the entire storage. 
When applying changes to the storage all changes are made using COW (copy on write)
techniques. Even a simple delete will cause a write cascade, from a leaf to the
root, to represent the change. Afterwards the new commit is referenced by a new transaction node.
As soon as the transaction node has made it to disk, at least the predecessor still
points to a valid state, however the pre-predecessor may now point to overwritten
data, so the possibilities of recovery are limited (comparable to <<zfs-magic>>), due to
the usage of free areas as declared by the 'free space tree'. Note that a writer may 
implement various algorithms to lower fragmentation by deferring writes and by prefer
writing to new areas instead of filling holes. Also a writer may defragment storage
by rewriting nodes and updating all related 'ndptrs', which is probably one of the
most expensive operations. On the other side one can use virtual addresses. But keep in mind, that using 
the reserved 'vdev' for the indirect address table, lookups will double the amount
of required in-memory space and doubles the amount of initial I/O to resolve values from
disk, which slows down everything else. Depending on the use case, this may be a good
choice to support faster defragmentation.

The transaction id is a strict monotonic number.

| #8 |32|hash| checksum |* | the hash of fields #0 - #7
|==============================================

As you can see, the size of a transaction node comes at 121 byte. This size needs not to be 
discussed because the amount of transaction nodes is constant and the minimal size should
be 2 anyway. In a perfect world, this will protect us when we get interrupted while
writing the transaction. There

Node relation overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following <<a:figure-vdevnodes,figure>> illustrates the basic node relations.
The 'vtable tree', 'free space tree', 'ref count tree', 'flat checksum tree' and
'hash tree' are all optional. Values of 0x00 in the transaction node signals that
no such tree has been defined yet. However if a certain tree should be used, is 
configured through the 'wbo' in the configuration node. The optional trees
are possibilities to optimize certain use cases but are just bloat for others.

The 'wbo' configuration options are defined as follows.

.wbo configuration for optional transaction trees
[width="100%", cols="3,^3,10", options="header"]
|==============================================
| Name| Type |  Description
| vtable_tree |bool|true if 'ndptr' should be virtual, false if they should be direct
| space_tree |bool|true if freed memory segments are tracked using this tree
| reference_count_tree |bool|true if nodes should be reference counted
| flat_checksum_tree |bool|true if nodes are checksumed in a flat way
| hash_tree|bool|true if nodes are hashed using a merkle tree
|==============================================

Commit node
~~~~~~~~~~~

A commit incorporates a bunch of parent commits, a list of named trees, 
a message and a unix timestamp. The most important thing is that it does never 
contain pointers but the hashed values of the trees and parents. 
When calculating the hash of a node it should be always prefixed (e.g. type) and 
postfixed (e.g. length) as it is done by e.g. git and recommended by the Sakura hash tree 
mode (see <<sakura>>) to create a strong hash tree and to form a merkle tree.

Note that depending on the chosen data, stream nodes are not hashed 
directly and therefore are not part of the merkle tree. This is an explicit design 
decision to give writers the freedom to distribute data nodes at will to e.g. 
improve copy-on-write efficiency or e.g. remote delta updates by desired redundancy in 
different pack files.

.on-disk format of the commit node
[width="100%", cols="2,^3,^3,^4,^3,10", options="header"]
|==============================================
| Order| Size | Type | Name | Value | Description
| #0 |1 |uint8 | node type | 0x04 | type 'commit'
| #1 |8|int64| timestamp | * | milliseconds since epoch. This is considered as a hint for humans, not for the system. Timed order is defined by referring to parent commits.
| #2 |1-*|varuint| len | * | Length of the message array in bytes as 'len'
| #3 |'len' |[]uint8| payload | *|  byte array containing a message payload. The format of this message is part of the application's domain and not specified, e.g. it may just be an utf8 string, but also a binary blob.
| #4 |1-*|varuint|count|*|Amount of trees in this commit as count
| #5 |'count'* named tree|[]named tree|trees|*|sorted list of trees, each with a byte array as name, followed by it's hash.
|==============================================

A named tree is just a varuint prefixed byte array as the key, followed by the 32 byte of the
hash. The key (or name) may be an arbritary byte sequence, but it makes sense to keep it 
as an UTF8 string.

.on-disk format of a named tree
[width="100%", cols="2,^3,^3,^4,^3,10", options="header"]
|==============================================
| Order| Size | Type | Name | Value | Description
| #0 |1-*|varuint|count|*|length of the key as 'len'
| #1 |'len' |[]uint8| payload | *|  the key or name of the following tree
| #2 |32 |hash| hash of tree | *| the hash of the referenced tree
|==============================================

In the following some reserved and predefined keys are explained.
The 'f' or 0x66 is used as the default 'filesystem' anchor.
The 'r' or 0x72 is used as the default 'relational' anchor, using
the same hierarchical key/value logic as the filesystem. 
Relational data is stored in the 'wbo' format without any schema.

.known keys for named trees
[width="100%", cols="^2,^3,10", options="header"]
|==============================================
| Hex| ASCII | Description
| 0x66 |f|the default filesystem tree
| 0x72 |r|the default relational tree
|==============================================

TODO: separate merkle tree in the transaction seems not to make sense and is not worth the effort.
