Preface
-------
The idea of a robust, simple and scalable storage format superseeding the 
lowest denomiator filesystems, fascinated me already 15 years ago, 
however I never had the opportunity to actually start implementing such a project. 
When the time came, I started to design a paper based specification in 2015 which 
performs well for deduplicating large files, nested directory trees and 
continues snapshots. To solve the typical problems of a 'multi file based 
document format' at work, I created a proprietary java based implementation 
from it, called wiz - which is just the opposite of a git, similarities are 
purely coincidental. For the original intention, it worked pretty well. 
But as requirements changed, the performance for a lot of additional use 
cases was disappointing. The main performance issues are caused by both, 
inherent format decisions and the necessity of a complex virtual machine. 
In practice, the latter caused also penalties on the probably most successful 
mobile platform of our time. To solve all of these issues I started to design 
an entirely new specification which addresses all of the new additional 
scenarios (and even more). Hereafter this new specification is actually 
'wiz version 3' or simply 'wiz'. Therefore the proprietary existing wiz 
implementation is called 'legacy wiz' and is not only implemented in a 
different language but also does a lot of things differently to improve 
performance, storage usage, reliability and system complexity. 
Today, the market for closed source commercial software libraries is nearly 
dead and gaining money or finding acceptance is not easy. 
Usually large companies dominate the market with a lot (but definity not all) 
high quality products.



Format specification
--------------------
Wiz is both, an implementation and a specification.
In this chapter only the specification matters and is described 
in a way that it can be implemented in any language or ecosystem.
Just like ZFS, it addresses it's content using 128bit pointers.

A node always starts with a byte identifier and is otherwise undefined. 
Most lengths uses a varuint so that it has an adaptive overhead which 
increases dynamically as the payload size increases. 
Overhead also depends on the used compression algorithm, if a node supports 
that at all. The payload of a node should not exceed something reasonable, 
e.g. ZFS (see also <<zfs-spec>>) uses 128KiB but you may even go into the range of 
MiB to increase efficiency. 
The UTF8 type is always prefixed with a varuint length to 
increase efficiency for short strings but allowing also more than the 
typical 64k bytes. All numbers are treated as big endian to match 
network byte order. As a side note, even if most operating systems are 
little endian today, one cannot ignore BE systems, so any code must be 
endian independent anyway. It is not expected that wiz may profit from a 
system specific endianess, like ZFS does.

In the following, offsets are always defined in hexadecimal values prefixed by
0x. The size of the types is in bytes. In general everything is little endian (TBD).
There is no expectation that a machine specific endianess gives any performance
advantage, since it must be written in an independent way anyway.

.specification of types
[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| Size | Type |  Description
| 1-9 |varuint |  unsigned, as defined in <<varint>>
| 1-9 |varint |  signed, as defined in <<varint>>
| 8 |vdev id| arbritary array of bytes, must be unique for a vdev set
| 16 |ndptr |  a node pointer is a 128 bit address, where the first 8 byte determine the vdev (or file) and the last 8 byte determine the physical offset in the vdev.
|1-*|utf8| UTF-8 sequences are encoded with a prefix of the type 'varuint' followed by an arbritary amount of bytes
|==============================================

Magic node
~~~~~~~~~~
Marks a container and must be always the first node of a file and should not 
occur once again. If it does (e.g. for recovery purposes), it is not allowed 
to be contradictory. Wiz containers can simply be identified using the magic 
bytes '[0x00 0x77 0x69 0x7a 0x63]'.


.on-disk format of the magic node
[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| Offset| Size | Type | Name | Value | Description
| 0x00 |1 |uint8 | node type | 0x00 | type 'header'
| 0x01 |4 |[]uint8 | magic | [77 69 7a 63] | the magic header value
| 0x05 |4 |[]uint8 | sub magic | [* * * *] | the user defined sub magic header value
| 0x09 |4 |uint32 | version | 0x03 | this is the third version of the wiz format
| 0x13 |1 |uint8 | encryption type | * | the kind of encryption algorithm
|==============================================


The 'version' indicates which nodes and how they are defined. 
A node format may be changed in future revisions but should be 
extended in a backwards compatible manner. If such a thing is not 
possible (e.g. also by adding new kinds) the number increases. Because
the format depends on the node kind (and therefore the sizes to parse)
an outdated reader can actually only use it's recovery options to continue
reading.


_Some notes to the version flag: Actually this is the third generation of the 
wiz format. The first only existed on paper, the second was implemented largely 
based on the paper based specification but is proprietary. So this is the first 
which is now open source. It is not only implemented in a different language but 
also does a lot of things differently to improve performance, storage usage, 
reliability and system complexity._

The known sub format identifiers of all known publicly available sub format 
identifiers.

|==============================================
|Value | Description
|[77 69 7a 61] | 'wiza' the standard archive format of the command line tool
|[77 69 7a 62]| 'wizb' the format of the backup tool
|==============================================

The encryption formats are defined as follows:

[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
|Value | Description
|0x00|no encryption, all nodes are written as they are, just in plain bytes
|0x01|AES-256 CTR mode
|==============================================


See the encryption chapter for the detailed specification of each encryption mode.

Configuration node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The wiz repository (as defined by the file) may include different properties. 
These properties are important to open the repository properly, e.g. picking 
the correct hash algorithm. Also it may contain persistent optional settings for 
tweaking. This node must always be located at file offset 0x1000. It is not intended
to be modified on a regular basis.

.on-disk format of the configuration node
[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| Offset| Size | Type | Name | Value | Description
| 0x00 |1 |uint8 | node type | 0x01 | type 'configuration'
| 0x01 |*|kvobj| key value|*|key value properties in kvobj format
|==============================================

TBD define kvobj format (xdr like zfs?), better keep that small and put it into
it's own kvobj-node? (same as for nosql data nodes?)

Super node
~~~~~~~~~~
The super node is a ring buffer having 128 <<a:transaction-node,transaction entries>> which
are written in a round-robin manner. The transaction node with the highest transaction
id and a valid checksum is the transaction node to use. If something went wrong,
older transactions may be used for recovery, but the usefulness depends on the kind
of damage. Usually one would expect that if the transaction is written to the
ring buffer and the underlying file system crashes, it hopefully will loose the
data in the same order (the transaction node is always the last thing written), 
however there is no guarantee on that. Also fsync cannot protect us from that, 
because it is broken on many filesystems, even by design (see also <<btrfs-fsync>>).
Today, I don't know how to solve that properly. 

The super node is always located at file offset 0x2000 (TBD) and is defined
as follows.

.on-disk format of the super node
[width="100%",options="header"]
|==============================================
| Offset| Size | Type | Name | Value | Description
| 0x00 |1 |uint8 | node type | 0x02 | type 'super'
| 0x01 |128 * ?|[]tx-node| array|*|ring buffer of 128 transaction nodes
|==============================================

[[a:transaction-node]]
Transaction node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The transaction node is the entry point which defines an applied transaction
and all references to nodes which describe the valid state of the storage. This
includes references to the root nodes for snapshots (equivalent to tags and branches)
and also to additional trees, holding information about reference counts and deleted
nodes. The 'transaction id' is found in all other written nodes (TBD) to easily
identify which modifications belong a specific transaction (TBD, does not make sense
when overwriting! snapshots). The id is strict monotonic increasing.

| 0x01 |8|uint64| transaction id|*|increasing number
| 0x09 |8|ndptr|
