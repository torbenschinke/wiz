Preface
-------
The idea of a robust, simple and scalable storage format superseeding the 
lowest denomiator filesystems, fascinated me already 15 years ago, 
however I never had the opportunity to actually start implementing such a project. 
When the time came, I started to design a paper based specification in 2015 which 
performs well for deduplicating large files, nested directory trees and 
continues snapshots. To solve the typical problems of a 'multi file based 
document format' at work, I created a proprietary java based implementation 
from it, called wiz - which is just the opposite of a git, similarities are 
purely coincidental. For the original intention, it worked pretty well. 
But as requirements changed, the performance for a lot of additional use 
cases was disappointing. The main performance issues are caused by both, 
inherent format decisions and the necessity of a complex virtual machine. 
In practice, the latter caused also penalties on the probably most successful 
mobile platform of our time. To solve all of these issues I started to design 
an entirely new specification which addresses all of the new additional 
scenarios (and even more). Hereafter this new specification is actually 
'wiz version 3' or simply 'wiz'. Therefore the proprietary existing wiz 
implementation is called 'legacy wiz' and is not only implemented in a 
different language but also does a lot of things differently to improve 
performance, storage usage, reliability and system complexity. 
Today, the market for closed source commercial software libraries is nearly 
dead and gaining money or finding acceptance is not easy. 
Usually large companies dominate the market with a lot (but definity not all) 
high quality products.



Format specification
--------------------
Wiz is both, an implementation and a specification.
In this chapter only the specification matters and is described 
in a way that it can be implemented in any language or ecosystem.

A node always starts with a byte identifier and is otherwise undefined. 
Most lengths uses a varuint so that it has an adaptive overhead which 
increases dynamically as the payload size increases. 
Overhead also depends on the used compression algorithm, if a node supports 
that at all. The payload of a node should not exceed something reasonable, 
e.g. ZFS (see also <<zfs-spec>>) uses 128KiB but you may even go into the range of 
MiB to increase efficiency. 
The UTF8 type is always prefixed with a varuint length to 
increase efficiency for short strings but allowing also more than the 
typical 64k bytes. All numbers are treated as big endian to match 
network byte order. As a side note, even if most operating systems are 
little endian today, one cannot ignore BE systems, so any code must be 
endian independent anyway. It is not expected that wiz may profit from a 
system specific endianess, like ZFS does.

Chapters can contain sub-sections nested up to three deep.

Chapters can have their own bibliography, glossary and index.

And now for something completely different: ((monkeys)), lions and
tigers (Bengal and Siberian) using the alternative syntax index
entries.
(((Big cats,Lions)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Bengal Tiger)))
(((Big cats,Tigers,Siberian Tiger)))
Note that multi-entry terms generate separate index entries.

Here are a couple of image examples: an image:images/smallnew.png[]
example inline image followed by an example block image:

.Tiger block image
image::images/tiger.png[Tiger image]

Followed by an example table:
